    mastering: "The fundamental building blocks of computer science",
    seeking: "Summer 2026 internship to make real impact"
};
```

## My Arsenal
```python
class Nikolas:
    def __init__(self):
        self.strong_in = ["Python", "Java"]
        self.actively_learning = ["C++", "C", "SQL", "Machine Learning libraries"]
        self.tools = ["Git", "IntelliJ IDEA", "VS Code"]
        self.exploring = ["TensorFlow", "System Design concepts"]
        self.building = ["ML algorithms", "Data analysis projects", "OOP applications"]
   
    def philosophy(self):
        return "Write code that your future self will thank you for"
   
    def current_quest(self):
        return "Bridging the gap between theoretical CS and real-world impact"
```
